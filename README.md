# ThoughtKeeper
Simple note app to promote daily thought reflection.

Designed to allow the user to record a thought very quickly without seeing prior notes or interface.

At the end of the day, a digest of thoughts will be displayed.

All data must be stored locally on-device for privacy reasons.

## Current Project Goals
- Develop basic skills of Android app development.
- Allow me to quickly note down thoughts with a homescreen widget
- Present an interface to reflect on my thoughts at a specific time of day.
- After that, thoughts are removed (or archived in a separate section).

## Instructions for Build/Use
TBD, but fundamentally similar to most any Android application.

## Future Goals
- Statistics related to note-taking frequency
- Labels for thought categories (journaling can be kept separate from to-do, ideas, etc.)
- Basic on-device language analysis to highlight words and the emotions they convey
- System to track trends in thoughts and development between days
